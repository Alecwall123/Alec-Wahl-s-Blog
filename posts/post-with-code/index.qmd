We are doing are going to analyze, a built in r-dataset called "swiss" this is a dataset takenfrom various socioeconomic indicators from Swiss Provinces.

```{r}
library(readr)
library(parsnip)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

library(car)

library(lmtest)
library(broom)
library(dplyr)
library(leaps)
```

```{r}

data("swiss")

swiss %>%
  glimpse()

```

As seen above, this data has 6 including various different socioeconomic/fertility data from 47 different French-speaking Provinces.

```{r}
swiss %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Examination, y = Fertility)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Fertility vs. Examination",
       x = "Examination",
       y = "Fertility")
swiss %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Education, y = Fertility)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Fertility vs. Education",
       x = "Examination",
       y = "Fertility")

```

Lets first graph, fertility vs examination, then fertility vs education. Due to the nature of education potentially affecting the score someone has on the examination I am going to analyze whether adding an interaction term between these two predictor variable will improve the quality of my model.

```{r}

swissmodel1 <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(Fertility ~ Education+Examination, data = swiss)
tidy(swissmodel1)

swissmodel2 <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(Fertility ~ Education+Examination+Education:Examination, data = swiss)
tidy(swissmodel2)


```

As seen above, the p values for most of

```{r}


anova_result <- anova(swissmodel1$fit,swissmodel2$fit) %>%
  tidy()%>%
  print()

swissmodel1$fit%>%
  vif()

```
